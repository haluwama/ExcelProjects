# Examples

Each of these projects was used by me during my practice at Volvo Trucks. 

* Chart -  the purpose of this macro is to load data from Excel files and display them on the screen as a graph. The user can adjust what is displayed, set the range, axis names, and name of a chart.

* Fin stats - It is used to present and compare data from various years. This macro enables us to compare the company's results, as well as changes in revenue in percentage. Splitting data into categories is also possible, as the mother company can have many smaller subsidiaries. 

* Sender - In the corporation environment, sending emails to our colleagues is unavoidable. Sometimes it will be the same message, only adjusted to certain people. In this macro, you can add attachments and a message written in the Word.

* Spamer - In the company, we have many subdivisions with whom we want to communicate. Thanks to this tool, we can send emails according to the subject we have to.

* Splitter - thanks to this macro you can split one big file into many small files. Splitting the file by columns (eg. ID of users) is often necessary. You can test this option if you download all files into your computer.
