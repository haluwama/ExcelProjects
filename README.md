# Examples

Every project in this folder I used during my practice at the Volvo.

* Chart -  The purpose of this macro is to load data from Excel files and display them on the screen as a graph. You can set the range, what we see, axis name and chart.

* Fin stats - It is used to present data from various years. Thanks to this we can compare the results of our company, changes in revenue in percentage. It is possible to split data into categories because the mother company can have many smaller daughters. 

* Sender - In the corporation environment, we always send emails to our colleagues. Sometimes it is the same message but adjust to certain people. In this macro, we can add attachments and a message written in the Word.

* Spamer - In the company we have many subdivisions with whom  we want to communicate. Thanks to this tool, we can send mails according to the subject we have to.

* Splitter - It is a macro thanks to its, you can split one big file into many small files. We often meet with a situation, where we split the file by unique column (for example id of users). If you download all files into on your computer you can test it with an example file.
