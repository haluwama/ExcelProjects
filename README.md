# Examples

Every project in this folder I used during my practice at the Volvo.

* Splitter - It's a macro thanks to its, you can split one big file into many small files. We often meet with a situation, where we split the file by unique column (for example id of users). If you download all files into on your computer you can test it with an example file.

* Sender - In the corporation environment, we always send emails to our colleagues. Sometimes it's the same message but adjust to certain people. In this macro, we can add attachments and a message written in the Word.
